===================================

![screenshot](https://raw.github.com/JonnyXDA/SecurePasswordGenerator/master/screenshot.png "screenshot")

Generate highly secure, strong passwords with this secure password generator app.

★ Features ★
 - Easy to use, just press "Generate" to generate your unique password!
 - Selectable password length (current minimum of 5, maximum of 20)
 - You can choose lowercase, uppercase, numerals and special charaters to be included or excluded in the password
 - Copy the password to clipboard
 - Secure, your password is never stored in this apps data

Why this app?

Most password generation apps use an insecure psuedo-random java algorithm (instance of Random) which does not give you a completely unique and truly random password each time, therefore this system is flawed.
This application uses the SecureRandom instance which provides a cryptographically secure random password, therefore giving much more secure passwords which are less easy to hack.
